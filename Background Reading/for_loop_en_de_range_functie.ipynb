    "Thus far, our programs used a single statement for every operation we would like our program to execute. This is fine for very small programs without any repetition. However, as programs grow in size and complexity, you will encounter problems that are repetitive in nature. For example: What if we have a list, and we would like to do some special operation on each end every element. Programming this naively, we could get the length of the list and retrieve an element using indexing (remember starting a 0) and do our special operation and acces the next, do our operation again and repeat this over and over until we reached the end of the list. If the list is just 3 elements long this would not be such a problem, but what if the list is 10, 100, 1000 or even a million elements long? Just copying and pasting the same lines over and over and changing the index, doesn't seem like a wise decision anymore. Also, if we found a bug in our code we would have to change the code for the operation on many lines. This quickly leads to unreadable and badly maintainable code.\n",

    "Luckily, Python has functionality that allows us to repeat code on collections such as strings, lists and tuples (works on other collections too, as we will see later with dictionaries).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook we will introduce the concept of looping using a **`for` loop** and show you how you could use the **`range()` function** to perform an operation a specific number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop is part of the concept **flow control**. Flow control lets you determine the order of execution of your code. In later Notebook we will also see the if else conditional statements and while loop."
